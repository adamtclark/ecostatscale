Description: Implementation of the scaling functions presented in "General statistical scaling laws for stability in ecological systems" by Clark et al in Ecology Letters <DOI:10.1111/ele.13760>. Includes functions for extrapolating variability, resistance, and resilience across spatial and ecological scales, as well as a basic simulation function for producing time series, and a regression routine for generating unbiased parameter estimates. See the main text of the paper for more details.
