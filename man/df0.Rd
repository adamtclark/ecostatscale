\title{Simulate deterministic dynamics of a N competing species}
\usage{
df0(time, state, pars)

\arguments{
\item{time}{time step - ignored, but required for consistency with ode function}

\item{state}{vector of current states}

\item{pars}{parameter list, including matrix A with full interaction matrix (and growth rates along the diagonal)}
}
\value{
rate of change for each species
}
\description{
Helper function for symdynN, used to simulate dynamics between disturbance events.
